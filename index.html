                        <h3>City Rocked by Chain Explosions</h3>
                        <p>
                            A massive series of explosions erupted at the Ojhri Camp ammunition storage
                            facility early Monday morning, sending shockwaves across Rawalpindi and
                            Islamabad. Residents reported continuous blasts lasting several hours,
                            causing widespread panic and confusion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Live rockets and ammunition were hurled into the air, landing unpredictably
                            across populated areas. Roads were blocked, electricity was disrupted,
                            and thick smoke could be seen from miles away.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Emergency services struggled to reach affected zones as fires and debris
                            made rescue operations extremely difficult.

                        <h3>Casualties Overwhelm Hospitals</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hospitals in Rawalpindi and Islamabad were flooded with injured civilians
                            and military personnel. Doctors declared emergency conditions as medical
                            staff worked tirelessly to provide treatment amid limited resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Several soldiers and civilians sustained severe injuries caused by flying
                            debris and falling ammunition. Ambulances made repeated trips to the
                            explosion site as rescue efforts continued throughout the day.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Political and Military Response</h3>
                        <p>
                            The federal government ordered an immediate inquiry into the incident,
                            calling it a serious lapse in safety and management. Senior officials
                            assured the public that those responsible would be held accountable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Among the injured was then Federal Minister for Petroleum,
                            <strong>Khaqan Abbasi</strong>, who sustained wounds after being caught
                            in the fallout of the explosions. His condition was reported to be stable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Opposition leaders criticized the handling of sensitive military assets
                            and demanded transparency in the investigation process.
