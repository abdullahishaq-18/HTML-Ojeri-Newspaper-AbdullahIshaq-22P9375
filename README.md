## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper reporting on the Ojhri Camp incident using HTML only. The goal was to visually resemble the original newspaper layout while translating and rephrasing the content into English using proper semantic HTML structure.

## Features Implemented
- Semantic HTML5 tags (`header`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Table-based multi-column newspaper layout
- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` to `h4`)
- Inline styling for alignment and layout (no external CSS)
- Multiple images with descriptive `alt` attributes
- Lists to represent related news items
- HTML comments explaining major sections of the code

## Challenges Faced
The main challenge was recreating a complex newspaper-style layout without using external CSS. This was solved by carefully structuring the page using tables and semantic tags while maintaining readability and visual balance.
